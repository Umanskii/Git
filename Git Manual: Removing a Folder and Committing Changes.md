### Git Manual: Removing a Folder and Committing Changes

#### 1. **Check the Current Status**
   To see the changes made to the working directory, use:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   On branch main
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

   Changes not staged for commit:
     (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
           deleted:    folderholder

   no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
   ```

#### 2. **Stage the Deleted Folder for Commit**
   To stage the deleted folder, use the following:
   ```bash
   git add folderholder
   ```

#### 3. **Verify the Status After Staging**
   After staging, run `git status` again to confirm:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   On branch main
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

   Changes to be committed:
     (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
           deleted:    folderholder
   ```

#### 4. **Commit the Changes**
   To commit the deletion with a message, use:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "remove folderholder"
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   [main bd7d447] remove folderholder
    1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
    delete mode 100644 Part 5 - Linux Troubleshooting, LAMP Stack, Project/folderholder
   ```

#### 5. **Check the Status Again**
   To verify that the commit was made and the working directory is clean:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   On branch main
   Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
     (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```

#### 6. **Check the Short Status**
   You can also use the short status command to see changes in a more concise form:
   ```bash
   git status -s
   ```

#### 7. **Push the Changes to the Remote Repository**
   To push the commit to the remote repository, use:
   ```bash
   git push --all
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   Enumerating objects: 5, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
   Delta compression using up to 8 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 282 bytes | 282.00 KiB/s, done.
   Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)

   ```

Now your folder deletion is committed and pushed to the remote repository!
